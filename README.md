## Tongi-Keith-Aviation-Data-Analysis

This is a repository of an Analysis of Aviation Data as part of my submission for my Moringa School Phase 1 project.

The project is focused on Data Analysis of an Aviation Dataset documenting aviation accidents primarily in the United States, but also in the larger globe. The generated insights from my analysis are used to offer business insights to an aviation business seeking to launch. 

The dataset was obtained from the following Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses

Attached in this repository are the following:

1. A raw Aviation Data csv file.
   This is the csv file obtained from the Kaggle link shared above.
   
3. A cleaned Aviation Data csv file.
   This is a csv file that deletes some missing data, renames columns, and reorganises the appearance of the data.
   
5. A jupyter notebook.
   This contains code on the data cleaning process, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), some early visualisations, and preliminary conclusions and recommendations.
   You will notice that the analysis is narrowed down to the United States on account of the fact that most of the data is of aviation accidents in the US.
   
7. A tableau file.
   This contains sheets and a dashboard depicting various business areas of concern with regards to the aviation accidents. A link to the dashboard will also be attached 
   below.
   
9. A powerpoint presentation.
   This contains a summary of my research and insights, plus recommendations and next steps for the client.

Attached is my Tableau Dashboard link here for your perusal. Kindly note that it only contains a snapshot of my sheets: https://public.tableau.com/views/AviationDataDashboard_17455997384990/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
