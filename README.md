## Tongi-Keith-Aviation-Data-Analysis

This is a repository of an Analysis of Aviation Data as part of my submission for my Moringa School Phase 1 project.

The project is focused on Data Analysis of an Aviation Dataset documenting aviation accidents primarily in the US, but also in the larger globe.

The dataset was obtained from the following Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses

Attached in this repository are the following: 
A raw Aviation Data csv file; 
A cleaned Aviation Data csv file; 
A jupyter notebook containing code on the data cleaning process, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and preliminary conclusions and recommendations; 
A tableau file containing sheets and a dashboard; 
A powerpoint presentation summarizing my research.

I will attach my Tableau Dashboard link here for your perusal. Kindly note that it only contains a snapshot of my sheets: https://public.tableau.com/views/AviationDataDashboard_17455997384990/Dashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
